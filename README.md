# Loyalty-Tree-
A program I wrote for my Computer Science I class. Here is the prompt for this program:

### Objective 
Practice implementing a binary search tree. 
Practice coming up with a functional breakdown for a large program. 
Practice efficiently updating all necessary components of a data structure after each update. 

### Background Story 
Our theater is now done experimenting with pie shaped projectors (turned out to be a big fail!) 
Instead, they are going to copy the Universal Cinema Foundation and start a rewards program. 
Each guest gets 1 loyalty point for each dollar they spend at the theater. Over time, guests may 
gain loyalty points, use loyalty points to redeem prizes or query the number of loyalty points they 
have. On occasion, a guest may get very upset at the theater (maybe they showed the Taylor Swift 
movie one too many times), and request to be removed from the loyalty program.  One strange 
request the theater wants the program to handle is a query of how many users have names that 
come alphabetically before a particular user. 
Since the theater knows you are learning about binary search trees in class, they would like for you 
to implement this functionality via a binary search tree of nodes, where the nodes are compared 
via the name of the customer stored in the node, in alphabetical order. 

### Problem 
Write a program that reads in input corresponding to various changes and queries to the theater's 
loyalty program and prints out corresponding messages for each of the input commands. Here is 
an informal list of each of the possible commands in the input: 
(1) Add Loyalty Points to a particular customer. 
(2) Subtract Loyalty Points from a particular customer. 
(3) Delete a particular customer. 
(4) Search for a particular customer in the binary search tree. If the customer is found, report both 
their number of loyalty points and their depth in the tree (distance from the root in # of links to 
follow.) 
(5) Count the number of customers whose names come alphabetically before a particular customer. 
At the very end of the input, your program should store pointers to each struct storing customer 
data and sort that data by loyalty points, from highest to lowest, breaking ties alphabetically. (For 
two customers with the same number of loyalty points, the one whose name comes first 
alphabetically should be listed first.) This data should be sorted via either Merge Sort or Quick 
Sort.

### Input 
The first line of input contains a single positive integer: n (n â‰¤ 300,000), the number of commands 
to process. 
The next n lines will each contain a single command. Note: The commands will be such that the 
resulting binary search tree will never exceed a height of 100.  
Here is the format of each of the possible input lines: 

#### Command 1 
add <name> <points> 
<name> will be an lowercase alphabetic string with no more than 19 characters. 
<points> will be a positive integer less than or equal to 100. 
#### Command 2 
sub <name> <points> 
<name> will be an lowercase alphabetic string with no more than 19 characters. 
<points> will be a positive integer less than or equal to 100. 

Note: if a customer has fewer points than is specified in this command to subtract, then just subtract 
the total number of points they have instead. 
#### Command 3 
del <name> 
<name> will be a lowercase alphabetic string with no more than 19 characters. 
Delete the customer with the name <name> from the binary search tree. No action is taken if the 
customer isn't in the tree to begin with. 
#### Command 4 
search <name> 
<name> will be a lowercase alphabetic string with no more than 19 characters.

This will search for the customer with the name <name> and report both the number of loyalty 
points the customer has and the depth of the node in the tree storing that customer, if the customer 
is in the tree.  
#### Command 5 
count_smaller <name> 
<name> will be a lowercase alphabetic string with no more than 19 characters. 
This will calculate the number of names in the binary search tree that come alphabetically before 
<name>.

### Output  
For each input command, output a single line as described below: 
#### Command 1 
Print out a single line with the format: 
<name> <points> 
where <name> is the name of the customer who added points and <points> is the new total 
number of points they have. Note: If the customer is not in the binary search tree, then create a 
new node for them initialized to <points> number of points. If the customer is already in the 
binary search tree, just add <points> number of points to their current total. 
#### Command 2 
If the customer is NOT in the tree, print out a single line with the format: 
<name> not found 
If the customer is in the tree, print out a single line with the format: 
<name> <points> 
where <name> is the name of the customer who subtracted points and <points> is the new 
total number of points they have. Note: if the points to be subtracted was greater than the points 
they previously had, then after the operation, they will have 0 points left. 
#### Command 3 
If the customer in question wasn't found in the binary search tree, output the following line: 
<name> not found 
If the name is found, output a line with the following format: 
<name> deleted 
where <name> is the name of the customer being deleted. (Of course, delete the node storing that 
customer from the tree!) If you are deleting a node with two children, please replace it with 
the maximum node in the left subtree. This is to ensure there is one right answer for each 
test case.
#### Command 4 
If the customer in question wasn't found in the binary search tree, output the following line: 
<name> not found 
If the name is found, output a line with the following format: 
<name> <points> <depth> 
where <name> is the name of the customer being searched, <points> is the number of 
loyalty points they currently have and <depth> is the distance of the node the customer in 
question was found in from the root node of the tree. 
#### Command 5 
For this command, just print a single integer on a line by itself representing the number of names 
in the binary search tree that come before <name>, alphabetically. (Note: Because we require a 
run time of O(h), where h is the height of the tree, this is likely the most challenging command to 
process. The size field will be necessary in the node struct to make this determination in O(h) 
time.) 
After all commands in the input have been processed, create an array to store pointers to each 
struct storing customer data. Then, sort that array by customer loyalty points from highest to 
lowest, breaking ties by the names in alphabetical order as previously described. Finally, print out 
one line per customer in this sorted order with the format: 
<name> <points> 
where <name> is the name of the customer and <points> is the number of loyalty points they 
have at the end of the set of input commands. 

### Implementation Requirements/Run Time Requirements 
1. A binary search tree of nodes of time treenode will be used to store the data as commands are 
processed. 
2. The run-time for processing each of the commands should be O(h), where h is the current height 
of the tree. 
3. There should be two compare functions, one to be used by the binary search tree functions and 
a different one to be used by the sorting functions. 
4. Only one full copy of each customer struct should exist. The array to be sorted should be of type 
customer**, storing an array of pointers to structs. 
5. The sort implemented at the end of the program must be either Merge Sort or Quick Sort. 
6. Your code must compile and execute on the Eustis system. The C compiler on this system is the 
one that the graders will be using to grade/evaluate your submissions.
